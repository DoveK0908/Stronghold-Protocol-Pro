// public/js/render/fx/notes.js — content-owned notes (b.snap `proj`): 丰川祥子's 音符, the first visual that is NOT
// driven by a b.ev 'atk' event.
// Installed on FxSystem.prototype by ./system.js (a method container: never instantiated; `this` is the effect system).
//
// She fires her notes on her own (【自由移动】 when nothing is in range, then 【追踪移动】 — server/sim/content/kits/
// ops/op-oblvns.js `noteSteer`), so there is no attack to hang a projectile visual on and no target view to home on.
// The sim streams their authoritative positions in `b.snap.proj` (`[[id, x, y, kind]]`, server/sim/battle/events.js) and
// this file keeps one floating, haloed music glyph per projectile id — placed where the sim's own hit test has it, so a
// note lands with the damage it deals. `kind` is 'note' (her talent's) or 'noteSkill' (her skills'), which picks the
// style.js PROJ entry.
//
// A note is also HEARD the moment its id appears (owner report 「她发出音符时也应该有音效」): a note is born with no
// `atk` event of its own, so this new-id branch — not `handleBattleEvents` — is the only place the launch can be played.
// The sound is the manifest's `audio.sfx.proj[kind].born` (docs/ASSETS.md "投射物音效"; official bank
// `ON_PROJECTILE_BORN.projectile_…`), NOT the unit's `attack` (already played for her vis-less attack) and NOT its
// `born` (that is the DEPLOYMENT sound). Who owns the note only matters for the limiter's per-unit key: two notes born
// in the same frame are two units' (or one unit's two volleys), and each unit must be able to have its own copy — see
// the `lookup` below, which resolves the unit the client already knows (server-authoritative positions, client-side
// presentation only: nothing here recomputes gameplay).
